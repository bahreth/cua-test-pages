        <div class="doc-content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Llamas are domesticated South American camelids that have been used as pack animals for centuries. They are known for their gentle nature, soft wool, and distinctive appearance.</p>

            <div class="doc-image">[Image: Llama in Andean Mountains]</div>

            <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Adult llamas typically weigh between 250 to 450 pounds and stand about 5.5 to 6 feet tall at the head. They have a long neck, large ears, and a split upper lip. Their wool comes in a variety of colors including white, brown, gray, and black.</p>

            <h2>Behavior and Temperament</h2>
            <p>Llamas are social animals that live in herds. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including humming, which is their most common sound. Contrary to popular belief, llamas only spit when they feel threatened or are establishing dominance within the herd.</p>

            <h2>Uses and Benefits</h2>
            <p>Llamas have been used by Andean cultures for thousands of years as pack animals, capable of carrying loads of 50-75 pounds over rough terrain. Their wool is used for making clothing and textiles. Today, llamas are also popular as therapy animals and guard animals for sheep flocks.</p>

            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <ul>
